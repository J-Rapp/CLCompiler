# MegsList

This app stores a users parameters for a custom Craigslist search. It then executes that search on multiple chosen Craigslist locations at once and compiles the results. Lastly, it runs the search at automatic intervals and emails the user when any new listings are posted.

## Personal Learning Outcomes

I spent a lot of time researching opinions about what belongs in `app/services` vs `lib`, and as a result I think I have a decent start to a potential Craiglist gem living in my `lib` directory.

## Aren't there already a handful Craiglist compilers out there?

Sure, but I had fun making this and learned a lot in the process.

---

## Why "Meg"?

Because it rhymes with Craig, and women are underrepresented.
